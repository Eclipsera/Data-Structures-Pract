1. Find longest consecutive sequence in binary tree.

2. Construct a binary tree from given postorder and inorder traversals.

3. Check whether a binary tree is a full binary tree or not.

4. Find sum of all left leaves in a given binary tree.

5. The Celebrity Problem: In a party of N people, only one person is known to everyone. Such a person may or may not be at the party, if yes,
(s)he doesn’t know anyone at the party. 
We can only ask “does A know B?“. Find the stranger (celebrity) in minimum number of questions.  
We can describe the problem input as an array of numbers/characters representing persons in the party. 
We also have a hypothetical function HaveAcquaintance(A, B) which returns true if A knows B, false otherwise. The relation is not symmetrical.  

6. Convert min binary heap to max binary heap.
