Implement a self-balancing binary search tree (AVL tree) 
with the following operations: insertion, deletion, search.

Some helper methods when balancing: rotate (left or right depending on
which subtree has caused disbalance), check for balance 
(are there nodes whose children's heights differ by more than 1), 
calculate difference in height between two nodes.
